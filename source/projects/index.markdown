An [alternate reality game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game), where players worked with a sentient AI to infiltrate research offices, steal data and of course â€¦save the world. Created an interactive story using automated calls/SMS, partnership from local businesses, some abandoned offices and a pinch of live acting.  

###Barcamp GroupHug
A social experiment on guerrilla marketing and group dynamics. Intriguing posters + QR codes + GoPro = hugging? This one failed hardcore - learned a lot though.

###Powerpoint KTV
A ridiculous improv game where the player is put in front of an audience and a random PPT. The player must then immediately give a presentation based on said PPT. Hilarity ensues.
