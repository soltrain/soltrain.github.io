###Hello! 

My name is Noah, I'm a Product Manager for a startup called [Bon App](http://www.bonapp.cn) in Shanghai, China. In the past I was part of a rotational program at Chevron and a volunteer at [The Bread Project](http://www.breadproject.org/).

While not Product Managing, you might find me [playing](http://www.meetup.com/Shanghai-Ukulele-Players/) [ukulele](http://tenderloinukuleleensemble.bandcamp.com/), organizing [flash mobs](http://shanghaiist.com/2012/11/02/watch_halloween_flashmob_in_dalian.php), or running free, pubic [tech events](http://www.techyizu.org/). A while back I designed and ran an [ARG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al]ternate_reality_game), turns out the site is ~~[still up!](http://www.contactdalian.com/)~~ now down but pictures are [here](http://www.nsolnick.com/projects).

###Contact
You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahsolnick), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/soltrain33), Facebook and the like. Hit me up on email at first name dot last name at gmail. My [GitHub is here](https://github.com/soltrain) and I need to be more active on it.
