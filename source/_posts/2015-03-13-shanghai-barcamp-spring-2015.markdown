#Welcome Shanghai Barcampers! (again)
If you're reading this, you may have arrived here from the the [grouphug experiment](http://www.nsolnick.com/grouphug) at this year's Barcamp. If so, awesome! I hope you had an memorable experience. You may find that some of the header links on this page are broken. This is not a bug, they are not broken, you have just arrived prior to their creation.  :)
